# port4me

The **port4me** algorithm is implemented in Bash and R. Please see
their NEWS files for updates:

 * [bash/NEWS.md](bash/NEWS.md)
 
 * [r/NEWS.md](r/NEWS.md)

In order to provide a consistent user experience regardless of
language, we attempt to keep the Bash and R APIs in sync as far as
ever possible.  This means that we try to synchronize updates between
them.
