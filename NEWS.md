# port4me

The **port4me** algorithm is implemented in Bash, Python, and
R. Please see their NEWS files for updates:

 * [bash/NEWS.md](bash/NEWS.md)
 
 * [python/NEWS.md](python/NEWS.md)
 
 * [r/NEWS.md](r/NEWS.md)

In order to provide a consistent user experience regardless of
language, we attempt to keep the Bash, Python, and R APIs in sync as
far as ever possible.  This means that we try to synchronize updates
between them.
